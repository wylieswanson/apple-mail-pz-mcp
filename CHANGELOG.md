## [Unreleased]

### Changed

**`update_rule` absorbs `set_rule_enabled` (#130):** The standalone `set_rule_enabled` MCP tool is removed; toggle a rule's enabled state via `update_rule(rule_index, enabled=True|False)` instead. `update_rule` now prompts for confirmation only when the patch touches `conditions`, `actions`, or `match_logic` (irreversible fields); patches limited to `enabled` and/or `name` skip the prompt. Migration: callers that did `set_rule_enabled(idx, True)` should call `update_rule(idx, enabled=True)`. First of the consolidations from the #129 audit (27 → 20 tools).

**`search_messages` absorbs `get_selected_messages` (#131):** The standalone `get_selected_messages` MCP tool is removed; pass `source="selected"` to `search_messages` to retrieve Mail.app's current UI selection. When `source="selected"`, all filter parameters (`account`, `mailbox`, `sender_contains`, `subject_contains`, `read_status`, `is_flagged`, `date_from`, `date_to`, `has_attachment`, `limit`) are silently ignored — selection is global to Mail.app. Message bodies are always included on the `content` row field; the prior `include_content` knob is dropped (callers that need to suppress bodies can post-process). The `account` parameter is now optional in the `search_messages` signature; with `source="all"` (default) it remains required, returning a `validation_error` if omitted. Migration: callers of `get_selected_messages()` should call `search_messages(source="selected")`. Second consolidation from the #129 audit.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-03

Performance and ergonomics release. The IMAP delegation arc started in v0.5.0 is now complete: `search_messages`, `get_message`, `get_attachments`, and `get_thread` all delegate to IMAP transparently when configured, with a clean cross-provider fallback story. Headline numbers: search drops 60s → 2.7s on a populous mailbox, the IMAP fast path is wired through every read tool, and a small per-account circuit breaker keeps offline / stale-credential bursts bounded. Setup is no longer a four-line raw-shell incantation — there's a real CLI with verification.

### Added

**Setup-IMAP CLI (#76):** New `apple-mail-mcp setup-imap --account <name>` subcommand replaces the raw `security add-generic-password` recipe. Prompts for the password via `getpass` (no shell history), writes the Keychain entry idempotently, opens an IMAP connection to verify the password actually works, rolls back on auth failure. `--uninstall` removes the entry. `--email` overrides the Mail.app-derived default for the rare alias case. Default invocation (no subcommand) still starts the MCP server, so Claude Desktop is unaffected. (#116)

**IMAP delegation for read tools:**
- `get_message` (#72): one-round-trip lookup via `SEARCH HEADER Message-ID` + `FETCH` when `account` and `mailbox` are supplied. Replaces the AppleScript account×mailbox scan (~6-18s worst case). New `headers_only` knob skips body fetch when only metadata is needed. Surfaced + fixed a latent identifier mismatch: AppleScript path uses Mail.app's internal numeric id; IMAP returns RFC 5322 Message-IDs. Callers who forward `account`+`mailbox` from `search_messages` now stay on the IMAP path consistently. (#117)
- `get_attachments` (#73): one BODYSTRUCTURE FETCH replaces the per-attachment property loop. Also surfaces three classes of attachment Mail.app's AppleScript silently drops: forwarded `message/rfc822` parts, multipart/related inline images with filenames, Unicode filenames. (#119)
- `get_thread` (#122): tiered, capability-detected dispatch. Tier 1 is Gmail's `X-GM-THRID` against `[Gmail]/All Mail` — ~5 round-trips, mailbox-count-independent (replaces ~1100 round-trips on a 91-label account when All Mail is exposed over IMAP). Falls through cleanly to the existing per-mailbox header-search BFS when the capability or `[Gmail]/All Mail` isn't available. (#126)

**IMAP connection pooling (#75):** New `ImapConnectionPool` class — opt-in via `APPLE_MAIL_MCP_IMAP_POOL=1` env var, default off. Caches IMAP sessions keyed by `(host, email)`, with idle-timeout reconnect (270s default), per-connection locking (thread-safety designed in even though FastMCP is single-threaded today), and invalidation on protocol/network errors. **Live measurement on a 5-call interactive workflow against iCloud: 10.6s → 6.3s, ~40% faster.** (#120)

**IMAP failure circuit breaker (#118):** Per-account 30s cooldown on `AppleMailConnector` after non-benign IMAP failures. Bursts of calls during offline / stale-credential conditions stop wasting round-trips on the same broken account. Specialized `LoginError` warning text now names the exact `setup-imap` command — surfaces silent IMAP degradation that the AppleScript fallback otherwise hides indefinitely. (#121)

**Benchmark suite (#31):** Captured baselines for search, attachment, bulk-ops, and pool scenarios. `make benchmark` / `make benchmark-baseline` Makefile targets. Skipped by default; opt-in via `--run-benchmark`. (#100)

**`get_selected_messages` tool (#11):** Returns the messages currently selected in Mail.app's UI. External contribution.

### Changed

**`search_messages` AppleScript fallback path is 22× faster on large mailboxes (#32).** Replaced `whose <filter>` server-side predicate (which forces full-mailbox materialization on Mail.app's side) with manual reverse-order iteration plus per-message IF filters. Live: 60s → 2.7s on a populous mailbox; new `search_messages_with_zero_matches` benchmark confirms full-scan worst case stays bounded. INFO-level log fires when AppleScript search exceeds 5s, pointing users at IMAP setup. **Observable behavior change**: results now return newest-first; previously oldest-first. Callers that relied on the old order should reverse the result list. (#114)

**Bulk operations cubic loop fix (#103).** `move_messages`, `flag_message`, `mark_as_read`, `delete_messages` accepted a new optional `source_mailbox` parameter that narrows the AppleScript scan from O(N × accounts × mailboxes) to O(N) when the caller knows where the messages are. (#112)

**`/merge-and-status` slash command** now surfaces untriaged contributor issues alongside contributor PRs. (#104, #105)

### Fixed

**`delete_messages(permanent=True)` was a silent no-op (#111).** Empirically probed Mail.app's AppleScript surface — confirmed there's no path to permanent-delete that bypasses Trash. Parameter now emits `DeprecationWarning` so callers see the gap; docs corrected to describe actual behavior; AppleScript path unchanged (still moves to Trash, recoverable). (#115)

**Dependency bumps:** fastmcp ≥3.2.4, pytest ≥9.0.3, ruff ≥0.15.12, mypy ≥1.20.2, pytest-cov ≥7.1.0. uv.lock regenerated. (#106-110, #113)

**`check_dependencies.sh`** now invokes pip-audit via `uv run` — fixes a CI-only failure mode. (#99)

### Documentation

**Research: IMAP thread-discovery strategies** (`docs/research/imap-thread-strategies.md`, #80, #124). Empirical capability survey of iCloud, Gmail, and documented-from-public-docs Fastmail/Dovecot. Discovered iCloud doesn't advertise THREAD (contradicting public claims), Gmail doesn't advertise THREAD on the live account, and Gmail's `[Gmail]/All Mail` is opt-in over IMAP. Recommended a tiered, capability-detected dispatch — Tier 1 (X-GM-THRID) shipped in #122; Tier 2 (RFC 5256 THREAD) tracked as #123, Tier 1.5 (per-mailbox X-GM-THRID for hidden All Mail) tracked as #125. Both deferred to v0.7.0.

**README** rewritten to reflect the new IMAP setup flow (single CLI command instead of raw `security` recipe).

### Tooling

- `pyproject.toml` `version = "0.6.0"`
- `__init__.py` `__version__ = "0.6.0"`

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-26

Major minor release. Fifteen new MCP tools across four feature areas (account discovery, rule management, email templates, IMAP-backed performance), several long-standing AppleScript-injection bugs closed, and contributor-experience tightening prompted by an honest look at how earlier external PRs got handled. The README, CONTRIBUTING.md, and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` were all reworked to make the project safer and more welcoming to contribute to.

### Added

**Rule CRUD (#63):** `set_rule_enabled`, `create_rule`, `update_rule`, `delete_rule`. Addresses rules by 1-based positional index (rules have no stable id in Mail.app's AppleScript interface). Medium-tier schema: 6 condition fields × 5 operators, AND/OR match logic, 7 actions. Full-replacement semantics for `actions`; condition-replacement is refused with a typed error due to a recursion bug in Mail.app on macOS Tahoe (`-[MFMessageRule(Applescript) removeFromCriteriaAtIndex:]`) that crashes Mail on any condition-deletion path. (#84)

**Email templates (#30):** `list_templates`, `get_template`, `save_template`, `delete_template`, `render_template`. File-per-template storage at `~/.apple_mail_mcp/templates/<name>.md` (overridable via `APPLE_MAIL_MCP_HOME`). Simple `{placeholder}` substitution with reply-context auto-fills (`recipient_name`, `recipient_email`, `original_subject`, `today`). Render-only API — caller passes the result to existing `reply_to_message`/`forward_message`/`send_email`. First persistent-state feature in the project; the `~/.apple_mail_mcp/` convention is documented in CLAUDE.md. (#85)

**Discovery & threads:**
- `list_accounts` returns each account's id (UUID), display name, email addresses, type, and enabled state (#62, closes #26)
- `list_rules` lists Mail.app rules with index, name, and enabled state (#64, closes #27)
- `get_thread` reconstructs conversations using IMAP THREAD when available, falling back to AppleScript header-based reconstruction (#67, #81; closes #29 and #66)
- `search_messages` gains 4 new filters: `is_flagged`, `date_from`, `date_to`, `has_attachment` (#65, closes #28)

**IMAP-backed performance:**
- New `imap_connector.py` and `keychain.py` modules. When a Keychain entry exists for an account, search and thread tools transparently use IMAP for server-side execution (~1s vs 1-5s); on any IMAP failure they silently fall back to AppleScript with no functional loss. (#78, #79; closes #40 and #41)
- IMAP graceful-degradation invariants documented (#71)
- IMAP auth path decision documented after Keychain-spike findings (#69, #70; closes #39 and #68)

**Account-id (UUID) acceptance:** Account-gated tools now accept either the display name or the stable account UUID (returned by `list_accounts`). Names remain valid for convenience; UUIDs survive renames. (#82, closes #61)

**Documentation & contributor experience:**
- `docs/guides/SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md` unifies security guidance previously scattered across CLAUDE.md (#93, closes #87)
- CONTRIBUTING.md adds an acknowledgment to early contributors whose PRs were closed without comment, plus issue-first workflow guidance and granular test requirements (#93, closes #87)
- PR template surfaces linked-issue and tests-added checks as explicit fields (#95, closes #88)
- README adds a pre-1.0 warning recommending version pinning (#96, closes #89)
- Tools count in README and CLAUDE.md brought current (14 → 26)

**Tooling:**
- `/merge-and-status` slash command now surfaces open PRs from external contributors so they don't sit unreviewed (#94, closes #90)

### Fixed

- **AppleScript injection in 6 connector methods.** `mark_as_read`, `move_messages`, `flag_message`, `delete_messages`, `reply_to_message`, and `forward_message` interpolated raw message IDs into AppleScript without escaping. Each ID is now individually sanitized + escaped + quoted. Original report by [@martparve](https://github.com/martparve) in #34, with regression test guards added in this release.
- **Crashes on UUID-style message IDs.** `get_message`, `get_attachments`, `_resolve_thread_anchor_applescript`, and `save_attachments` interpolated escaped IDs without surrounding quotes; AppleScript then parsed dashes/dots/`@` in iCloud-format IDs as syntax tokens and errored. Wrapped the escaped value in literal quotes everywhere. (#34, closes #86)
- Pyright false positives for `imapclient` calls (#83)

### Changed

- GitHub Actions: `actions/checkout` 4 → 6, `astral-sh/setup-uv` 6 → 7 (#13, #14)
- Coverage now 92% (was 95% in v0.4.1); new connector and template code accounts for the small drop. Floor remains 90%.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-19

Patch release: dep hygiene and v0.4.0 follow-ups. Four connector bugs that unit tests couldn't catch were surfaced by running the three new integration tests against real Mail.app.

### Added
- Integration tests for `list_accounts`, `get_message`, and `get_attachments` against real Mail.app, fulfilling the #23 design doc commitment (#57)

### Changed
- Bumped transitive deps to clear `pip-audit` findings from the v0.4.0 release: `authlib` 1.6.9 → 1.7.0, `cryptography` 46.0.6 → 46.0.7, `pytest` 9.0.2 → 9.0.3, `python-multipart` 0.0.22 → 0.0.26. `fastmcp`/`mcp`/`pydantic`/`starlette`/`uvicorn` unchanged (#57)

### Fixed
- `search_messages` with no filter conditions emitted `messages of mailboxRef whose true` — Mail rejected with error -1726. The `whose` clause is now dropped entirely when no filters are supplied (#57)
- `search_messages` with a `limit` emitted `items 1 thru N of (messages of mailboxRef …)` — Mail rejected with error -1728. Replaced with a `count of` + indexed `item i of` repeat loop (#57)
- `_run_applescript` error-substring matcher checked for straight-apostrophe `Can't`, but macOS stderr uses curly `Can’t`. `MailAccountNotFoundError` and `MailMailboxNotFoundError` were silently degraded to generic errors. Curly apostrophes are now normalized before dispatch (#57)
- Several AppleScript record keys (`subject`, `sender`, `content`, `date_received`, `read_status`, `flagged`, `mime_type`, `downloaded`, `email_addresses`, `unread_count`) were silently dropped by NSJSONSerialization when values came from live Mail objects. Extended the prior `|name|` / `|id|` / `|size|` quoting to **every** record key across all 5 JSON-emitting methods (#57)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-19

Quality and infrastructure milestone. No new MCP tools; focus on test coverage, safety, and parsing robustness.

### Added
- Test-mode safety system (`MAIL_TEST_MODE`, `MAIL_TEST_ACCOUNT`) — account-gated destructive operations are constrained to a designated test account and sends are constrained to RFC 2606 reserved domains (#19)
- Three-tier sliding-window rate limiting (general / send / expensive) replacing the previous stub (#17)
- Proper MCP elicitation for destructive operation confirmation, replacing the previous stub (#18)
- Unit tests for all 14 `server.py` MCP tool handlers, lifting coverage from 0 % to 99 % (#16)
- E2E tests exercising FastMCP tool registration, schema, and invocation — 20 in-process tests covering all 14 tools (#21)
- stdio subprocess smoke test verifying the real MCP transport layer (#50)
- Blind-agent eval framework under `evals/agent_tool_usability/` — 36 scenarios across 9 categories, runnable against any OpenRouter-accessible model (#22)
- `docs/guides/COMPLEXITY.md` — rationale and exception table for the CC ≤ 20 ceiling (#24)
- IMAP hybrid-approach research document (#15)

### Changed
- AppleScript output now emits JSON via ASObjC + `NSJSONSerialization` instead of the fragile pipe-delimited format that broke silently when any field contained `|` (#23). Finishes previously-placeholder `list_accounts` and `list_mailboxes` return shapes.
- Coverage threshold raised from 60 % to 90 % in both `pyproject.toml` and CI, matching the documented target (#20)
- Pre-commit hook now enforces version sync across `pyproject.toml`, `__init__.py`, and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — failures block the commit locally instead of surfacing later in CI (#25)

### Fixed
- Three `NSJSONSerialization` selector-collision bugs discovered during the JSON-output migration's integration smoke: `name`, `id`, and `size` AppleScript record keys were silently dropped and are now quoted as `|name|`, `|id|`, `|size|` (#23)
