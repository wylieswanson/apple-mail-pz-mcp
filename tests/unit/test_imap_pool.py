"""Tests for ImapConnectionPool (issue #75).

The pool reuses IMAPClient sessions across calls keyed by (host, email).
These tests cover:

- Reuse: same key → same client; login() runs once across N calls.
- Per-account isolation: different keys → independent clients/locks.
- Idle reconnect: stale entries are dropped + reopened transparently.
- Error invalidation: LoginError / IMAPClientError / OSError drops the
  cached entry so the next call gets a fresh connection.
- Per-connection locking: one client serializes use across threads.
- close(): logs out every cached client.
- ImapConnector wiring: methods route through the pool when one is set.

The IMAPClient class itself is mocked at the module level — these are
unit tests, no real network.
