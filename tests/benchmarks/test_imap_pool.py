"""Benchmarks for the IMAP connection pool (issue #75).

Per #75's acceptance criterion: a benchmark must demonstrate measurable
speedup on a realistic repeat-call workflow. The shape is the natural
interactive burst — search → get_message → get_attachments → search →
get_message — five sequential IMAP calls against the same account.

Skips gracefully when:
- No Keychain entry for the test account (IMAP path can't run).
- The test account's INBOX is empty (no message id to feed get_message
  / get_attachments).

Two benchmarks captured side by side:
- ``imap_repeat_5_calls_no_pool`` — current behavior, one TCP+TLS+LOGIN
  per call (~5 × ~400 ms overhead).
- ``imap_repeat_5_calls_pooled`` — one connection reused across all
  five calls (~1 × ~400 ms overhead).

The delta is the pool's headline win.
