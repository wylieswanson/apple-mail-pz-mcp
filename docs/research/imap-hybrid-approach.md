# IMAP Hybrid Approach — Research Findings

**Status:** Keychain-retrieval assumption **falsified 2026-04-22** — see [Spike Findings (#39)](#spike-findings-39-2026-04-22) below. Auth path decided in [`imap-auth-options-decision.md`](./imap-auth-options-decision.md) (user-supplied Keychain item per account). The "Authentication: macOS Keychain" section of this document is superseded by that decision.

## Question

AppleScript has fundamental limitations (O(accounts×mailboxes) message lookup, fragile pipe-delimited parsing, no threading). Is there a native macOS framework — like Calendar's EventKit — we could use instead? If not, what are the alternatives?

## Finding: No Swift framework for Mail on macOS

Unlike Calendar (which has EventKit), Apple never built a public Swift framework for Mail.app data access on macOS.

- **MailKit** is iOS-only (`MessageUI` / `MFMailComposeViewController`)
- **Apple Mail plugin API** is deprecated and sandboxed
- There is no EventKit equivalent for Mail

The realistic alternatives are:

1. **AppleScript** (current) — most complete Mail.app automation, but fragile
2. **Direct IMAP** — bypasses Mail.app, talks to mail server directly
3. **Hybrid** — AppleScript for write/UI operations, IMAP for read/search

## Recommendation: Hybrid approach is viable

IMAP solves the biggest architectural problems without breaking the security model. The AppleScript path remains for operations that need Mail.app (compose, reply, forward, UI state).

## Method-by-method audit

### Could use IMAP (read/data retrieval)

| Method | Current Problem | IMAP Benefit |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| `search_messages` | Pipe-delimited parsing, single mailbox, limited filters | Server-side SEARCH, cross-folder, rich query syntax |
| `get_message` | O(accounts×mailboxes) nested loop | O(1) UID fetch |
| `get_attachments` | N+1 lookup, silent failures | BODYSTRUCTURE provides metadata natively |
| `save_attachments` | N+1 lookup for download | Partial fetch with byte ranges |

### Needs Mail.app (write/compose)

| Method | Why |
|--------|-----|
| `send_email` | Compose UI, account selection, signature |
| `send_email_with_attachments` | Attachment UI integration |
| `reply_to_message` | Quote handling, signature, compose UI |
| `forward_message` | Attachment forwarding, compose UI |

IMAP is receive-only. Sending needs SMTP, but we'd rather delegate to Mail.app than reimplement outbound message composition.

### AppleScript-only (Mail.app state)

| Method | Why |
|--------|-----|
| `list_accounts` | Mail.app object model |
| `list_mailboxes` | Mail.app hierarchy |
| `mark_as_read` | Could use IMAP flags, but color flags are Mail.app specific |
| `move_messages` | Gmail workaround uses Mail.app; true move in IMAP |
| `flag_message` | Color flags are Mail.app specific |
| `create_mailbox` | Mail.app specific |
| `delete_messages` | Trash state is Mail.app specific |

## Problems IMAP fixes

### 1. The N+1 message lookup

**9 of 15 methods** currently do this:

```applescript
repeat with acc in accounts
  repeat with mb in mailboxes of acc
    try
      set msg to first message of mb whose id is msgId
    end try
  end repeat
end repeat
```

With 3 accounts × 20 mailboxes, finding one message = 60 iterations. Marking 100 messages = 6,000 iterations. Each iteration is an AppleScript→Mail.app IPC roundtrip.

**IMAP equivalent:** `imap.uid('FETCH', message_id, 'ALL')` — O(1) or O(log n).

### 2. Pipe-delimited parsing

Current code in `search_messages`, `get_message`, `get_attachments`:

```python
parts = line.split("|")
```

Breaks silently when email subjects, senders, or attachment names contain `|`. No escape mechanism exists because AppleScript has no JSON serialization. IMAP returns structured binary data with length-prefixed fields — no parsing ambiguity.

### 3. No threading / conversations

AppleScript Mail API doesn't expose thread IDs. Conversations are a Mail.app UI construct, not data. IMAP has RFC 5256 THREAD extension (supported by Fastmail, Dovecot, Cyrus; Gmail uses its own X-GM-THRID).

### 4. Full-body fetches through stdout

`get_message` sends entire message body (potentially megabytes) through AppleScript→stdout→Python. No streaming, no partial fetch, no headers-only option.

IMAP supports `BODY[HEADER]` (headers only, ~1KB) and `BODY[TEXT]<0.10000>` (first 10KB of body).

### 5. Gmail label workaround race condition

`move_messages` with `gmail_mode=True`:

```applescript
duplicate msg to destMailbox
delete msg
```

Brief window where message exists in both places. If delete fails, message duplicates. No atomicity.

IMAP Gmail extensions provide atomic label operations:

```python
imap.copy(msg_id, '[Gmail]/Archive')
imap.store(msg_id, '+FLAGS', '\\Deleted')
```

## Authentication: macOS Keychain

> **Superseded 2026-04-22 — this section's premise was falsified by spike #39. See [Spike Findings](#spike-findings-39-2026-04-22). Retained for historical context; do not act on the claims below without re-validating.**

The key insight is that **Mail.app already stores IMAP credentials in the Keychain** when the user sets up an account. Python can retrieve them without prompting:

```bash
security find-internet-password -s imap.gmail.com -a user@gmail.com -w
```

This approach:
- **No credential storage** in MCP server (maintains current security model)
- **No OAuth re-implementation** (Mail.app handled the OAuth flow)
- **No user prompt** (Keychain access from Python is unrestricted)

### Auth caveats

- **OAuth2 accounts** (Gmail, Outlook) store app-specific passwords or OAuth tokens. The `security` command retrieves whatever Mail.app stored. Some OAuth setups may need the `email-oauth2-proxy` shim.
- **2FA** is handled at Mail.app setup time; by the time we retrieve from Keychain, it's a valid credential.
- **Keychain trust model**: Python scripts have unrestricted Keychain access. This is acceptable for a local MCP server the user controls.

## Protocol support

Common question: what about POP3-only accounts?

POP3-only is extremely rare in 2026. All major providers support IMAP:
- Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, iCloud, Fastmail, AOL, ProtonMail (via Bridge)

**Fallback design:** The hybrid is per-account, not all-or-nothing. If Keychain has IMAP credentials for an account, use IMAP. Otherwise fall back to AppleScript. The AppleScript path never goes away.

## Library choice: IMAPClient

| Library | Pros | Cons |
|---------|------|------|
| `imaplib` (stdlib) | No dependency | Low-level, synchronous, verbose |
| **`imapclient`** | **Mature, Pythonic, UID-aware, tested against all major providers** | **One new dependency** |
| `aioimaplib` | Async, IDLE support | Less mature, async doesn't fit current architecture |

**Recommendation:** `imapclient>=3.0.0`. Sync matches our current FastMCP architecture. IDLE/async can come later if needed.

## Proposed architecture

Not to be implemented until a future milestone, but the shape:

```
src/apple_mail_mcp/
├── server.py              # FastMCP tools (unchanged)
├── mail_connector.py      # Delegates read ops to IMAP when available
├── applescript_connector.py  # Renamed from current mail_connector logic
├── imap_connector.py      # New: IMAPClient wrapper for read operations
├── keychain.py            # New: macOS Keychain credential retrieval
├── security.py            # Unchanged
├── utils.py               # Unchanged
└── exceptions.py          # Add MailKeychainError, MailImapError
```

**Feature flag:** `MAIL_USE_IMAP=true` for opt-in during development. Default off until stable.

**Delegation logic:** see the [graceful-degradation invariants](./imap-auth-options-decision.md#graceful-degradation-invariants) in the decision doc. The sketch below shows the required runtime-fallback shape; the invariants doc is authoritative on exact failure classes and logging behavior.

```python
import socket
from imapclient.exceptions import LoginError, IMAPClientError

IMAP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_S = 3

class AppleMailConnector:
    def search_messages(self, account, mailbox, ...):
        if self._imap_available(account):
            try:
                return self._imap.search(account, mailbox, ...)
            except (OSError, socket.timeout, LoginError, IMAPClientError) as exc:
                self._log_imap_fallback(account, exc)
                # fall through to AppleScript for this operation
        return self._applescript.search(account, mailbox, ...)

    def send_email(self, ...):
        # Always AppleScript — sending needs compose UI. Never delegated.
        return self._applescript.send(...)
```

## When to implement

This research justifies the approach but does not justify immediate implementation. The right triggers are:

- **Issue #23** (replace pipe-delimited with JSON) — IMAP makes this moot for read ops; better to skip straight to IMAP
- **Issue #28** (advanced search filters) — IMAP SEARCH is far more capable than AppleScript `whose`
- **Issue #29** (get_thread tool) — impossible without IMAP THREAD extension

Follow-up issues #39, #40, #41 are on v0.5.0 as spikes.

## Spike Findings (#39, 2026-04-22)

### Context

Issue #39 was scoped as a proof-of-concept for the auth path described in the superseded section above: retrieve IMAP credentials from macOS Keychain via `security find-internet-password -s imap.<provider>.com`, connect via IMAPClient, fetch a single message. On first probing, the central assumption failed immediately — Mail.app on modern macOS (tested on macOS 26.3.1 / Darwin 25.3.0) does not store its IMAP credentials anywhere the `security` CLI can reach.

### Reproduction

Run [`scripts/probe_keychain_for_imap.sh`](../../scripts/probe_keychain_for_imap.sh). It enumerates both the login and System keychains, searches for items by IMAP protocol and by common provider hostnames, counts OAuth-token items, and tests whether the Internet Accounts DB is readable.

### Observed results (2026-04-22)

Machine: macOS 26.3.1 (Darwin 25.3.0). Mail.app has 5 configured accounts: Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, MobileMe (iCloud), Pitt (disabled).

```
--- Check 1: items with ptcl=imap or ptcl=imps ---
  /Users/Morgan/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db: 0 items
  /Library/Keychains/System.keychain: 0 items
  TOTAL: 0

--- Check 2: items matching common IMAP server hostnames ---
  imap.gmail.com: not found
  imap.mail.me.com: not found
  imap.mail.yahoo.com: not found
  outlook.office365.com: not found
  imap-mail.outlook.com: not found
  imap.fastmail.com: not found
  imap.aol.com: not found
  TOTAL MATCHES: 0 / 7

--- Check 3: OAuth tokens (Gmail/Google) ---
  Items with gena="Google OAuth": 2

--- Check 4: Accounts framework DB readability (TCC) ---
  /Users/Morgan/Library/Accounts: NOT readable (TCC-protected — grant Full Disk Access to test)
```

### Interpretation

On modern macOS:

- **No IMAP-protocol internet-password items exist** in either user-accessible keychain for any of the configured accounts. The original assumption (that `security find-internet-password -s imap.gmail.com` would return usable creds) is wrong.
- **Gmail auth is OAuth, not a stored password** — refresh tokens are present as generic-password items with `gena="Google OAuth"`, but they are not directly usable for IMAP LOGIN; they require XOAUTH2 plus token-refresh handling.
- **The Internet Accounts framework DB** (`~/Library/Accounts/Accounts4.sqlite`), where Apple consolidates account metadata on recent macOS, is protected by TCC. Reading it requires the user to grant Full Disk Access to whatever binary is performing the read — inappropriate for an MCP server that runs as the user.
- **iCloud accounts** (visible to Mail.app as `account type = iCloud`, not `imap`) go through Apple's Internet Accounts path entirely, not IMAP.

The conclusion is cheap and definitive: the spike's hypothesis is falsified on this configuration. Further validation on other machines is welcome but not load-bearing — the mechanism is system-level, not account-specific.

### Auth alternatives (to be evaluated in follow-up)

| # | Option | Trade-off |
|---|--------|-----------|
| a | User-supplied Keychain item under a known service name (e.g. `apple-mail-fast-mcp.<account>`) populated via a setup script | Simplest; works with app passwords across all providers; requires one-time user setup |
| b | Extract Google OAuth refresh tokens from Keychain and speak XOAUTH2 | Gmail/Google only; must handle token refresh; brittle against Google OAuth changes |
| c | Read the Accounts framework DB via a TCC-entitled helper | Requires user to grant Full Disk Access; entitlement distribution issues; heavyweight |
| d | Plain env vars / config file for IMAP credentials | Trivial to implement; no Keychain integration; worst UX and worst security story |
| e | Abandon IMAP; stay on AppleScript for all operations | Deletes the whole IMAP arc (#40, #41, #66); concedes the perf and threading wins of the hybrid design |

### Status of related issues

- **#39** — closed as a completed spike with negative result (this document is the deliverable).
- **#40** (IMAPClient integration for `search_messages`) — blocked. The IMAP perf prototype is meaningful only once auth is settled.
- **#41** (design `imap_connector.py` alongside `mail_connector.py`) — blocked. The delegation design assumed a working Keychain auth path.
- **#66** (IMAP-based thread reconstruction) — blocked, same reason.
- **#68** — new research issue to evaluate the five options above and recommend one.
