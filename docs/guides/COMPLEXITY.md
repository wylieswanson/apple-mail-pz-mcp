# Cyclomatic Complexity

This project enforces a cyclomatic complexity (CC) ceiling via `./scripts/check_complexity.sh`, run as part of `make check-all` and in CI.

## Threshold

**CC ≤ 20** per function / method. Any function with CC > 20 fails the build, unless it's in the allowlist (below).

The ceiling is intentionally generous. The goal is not to chase a low complexity score for its own sake — it's to flag functions whose branching has grown beyond what can be reasoned about while reviewing. A CC of 20 is roughly the upper bound of "I can hold this whole control-flow graph in my head." Beyond that, extract.

Why not CC ≤ 10 or CC ≤ 15? Several MCP tool functions in `server.py` naturally reach CC 11–16 because they chain independent validation gates (safety gate, rate limit, input validation, file existence, elicitation, connector call). Each gate is a single `if X: return error` — simple in isolation but additive in CC. Splitting them would fragment the linear gate-then-act pattern that makes server tools readable.

## The allowlist (per-function ceilings)

[`scripts/check_complexity.sh`](../../scripts/check_complexity.sh) carries a per-function allowlist mapping `(filename, qualified_name) → max CC`. Functions in the list pass the gate as long as their CC stays at or below the listed ceiling — a one-way ratchet. **Refactors that drop a function's CC should lower its allowlist entry to match** so future regressions are caught. Raising an entry requires updating this doc with the structural reason in the same PR.

New code over CC 20 not in the allowlist always fails the gate. To intentionally add a complex function (rare), add an entry alongside the function's introduction and document the reason here.

This mechanism replaced an earlier silent-pass bug (#174): the script ran `radon cc -n F` which filtered out everything below CC 41, so functions in the dangerous CC 21–40 range were never even evaluated against the threshold.

## Currently complex functions (CC ≥ 11)

The functions below sit above CC 10 intentionally. When touching them, prefer adding one more gate over restructuring. If a change would push any of them above 20, extract a helper first.

| File | Function | CC | Why it's complex |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`server.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/server.py) | `create_draft` | 19 | Unified compose / reply / reply_all / forward authoring loop with `send_now` opt-in; subsumes the four removed v0.6 send tools. Dropped from CC 36 → 19 in #191 by extracting `_resolve_create_draft_seed`, `_maybe_apply_template`, `_validate_fresh_seed_fields`, `_run_send_now_gates`, and `_persist_create_draft_seed`. |
| [`server.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/server.py) | `update_draft` | 18 | Same gate stack as `create_draft` plus the existing-draft lookup, three-tier subject/body resolution (caller > template > state), and delete-and-recreate semantics. Dropped from CC 34 → 18 in #192 by reusing `_run_send_now_gates` and `_persist_draft_seed` (both extracted in #191) plus adding `_resolve_update_subject_body` and `_merge_draft_recipients`. |
| [`mail_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/mail_connector.py) | `AppleMailConnector.create_draft` | 13 | Per-`seed_kind` AppleScript dispatch (compose vs reply/reply_all/forward), recipient list builders for to/cc/bcc, then save-vs-send tail. Dropped from 25 → 13 in #193 by extracting `_validate_create_draft_args`, `_build_attachment_block`, and `_build_creation_block`. |
| [`imap_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/imap_connector.py) | `_thread_via_xgm_per_mailbox` | 16 | Tier 1.5 (#125): anchor lookup with INBOX→Sent fallback, THRID FETCH, then per-folder iteration with \\Noselect / select-failure / fetch-failure handling. Dropped from 21 → 16 in #194/#195 by extracting the shared `_merge_envelope_fetch_into` helper that Tier 1.5 and Tier 2 both used inline. |
| [`imap_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/imap_connector.py) | `_thread_via_imap_thread` | 16 | Tier 2 (#123): per-mailbox SELECT + narrow-search + THREAD + cluster-walk + FETCH, with rejection branches at each step. Dropped from 21 → 16 in #194/#195 by extracting the shared `_merge_envelope_fetch_into` helper. |
| [`mail_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/mail_connector.py) | `AppleMailConnector.update_message` | 17 | Patch semantics: each optional field (`read_status`, `flag_color`, `destination_mailbox`, `flagged`, `source_mailbox`) adds a branch; mutation-order rules add a few more. Dropped from 21 → 17 in #174 by extracting `_try_imap_fast_paths` and `_build_flag_actions`. |
| [`mail_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/mail_connector.py) | `AppleMailConnector._search_messages_applescript` | 18 | Each optional filter (`sender_contains`, `subject_contains`, `body_contains`, `text_contains`, date range, `read_status`, `is_flagged`, `has_attachment`) generates an AppleScript IF clause. |
| [`mail_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/mail_connector.py) | `AppleMailConnector.update_mailbox` | 18 | Two delivery paths (rename via AppleScript, move via IMAP) plus the Gmail-system-label refusal pre-flight (#164). |
| [`imap_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/imap_connector.py) | `_bodystructure_has_attachment` | 18 | RFC 3501 BODYSTRUCTURE walk: nested multipart, disposition-vs-name detection, inline-image-with-filename surfacing. |
| [`server.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/server.py) | `update_mailbox` | 17 | Same gate stack as the v0.6 send tools (safety, rate limit, validation), plus the rename-vs-move dispatch and Gmail-system-label error mapping. |
| [`cli.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/cli.py) | `run_setup_imap` | 17 | Each setup failure mode (no Mail.app account, empty password, KeychainAccessDenied, IMAP login error, network error) rolls back the Keychain entry on a distinct branch. |
| [`mail_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/mail_connector.py) | `_validate_rule_actions` | 16 | One branch per AppleScript rule action that's not modeled in the schema (run-AppleScript, redirect, reply, play sound, ...). |
| [`mail_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/mail_connector.py) | `AppleMailConnector.update_rule` | 16 | Patch semantics across `enabled`, `name`, `conditions`, `actions`, `match_logic` plus the conditional-elicitation gate. |
| [`security.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/security.py) | `check_test_mode_safety` | 15 | Three distinct safety categories (reply-message block, account-gated operations, send-to-reserved-domain), each with sub-conditions. Splitting would hide the unified "is this safe?" question. |
| [`server.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/server.py) | `delete_mailbox` | 14 | Validation gates plus confirmation elicitation plus exception-to-`error_type` mapping (six exception classes). |
| [`imap_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/imap_connector.py) | `_thread_via_xgm_thrid` | 14 | Tier 1: anchor lookup, THRID FETCH, single-mailbox FETCH, with rejection branches. |
| [`imap_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/imap_connector.py) | `_find_thread_members_bfs` | 14 | Tier 3: nested per-folder × per-known-id × per-header SEARCH loop with select-failure handling. |
| [`server.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/server.py) | `update_message` | 13 | Patch validation across `read_status`, `is_flagged`, `flag_color`, `destination_mailbox`, plus the three-tool-replacement gate stack. |
| [`server.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/server.py) | `update_rule` | 12 | Same patch validation as the connector method plus the conditional elicitation. |
| [`imap_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/imap_connector.py) | `_build_search_criteria` | 12 | One branch per IMAP SEARCH key derived from the filter set. |
| [`imap_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/imap_connector.py) | `ImapConnector.search_messages` | 12 | Filter assembly + UID limit slicing + envelope translation, each adding a branch. |
| [`server.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/server.py) | `search_messages` | 11 | Validation across the expanded filter set (#145 added `body_contains` / `text_contains`; #131/#144 reshaped `source`). |
| [`mail_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/mail_connector.py) | `_collect_thread_applescript` | 11 | AppleScript-side BFS fallback when IMAP thread tiers don't apply. |
| [`imap_connector.py`](../../src/apple_mail_mcp/imap_connector.py) | `ImapConnector.get_message` | 11 | `headers_only` vs full-body fetch, search-by-bracketed-msgid path, error mapping. |

Accepted because: each is a sequence of orthogonal gates or optional-parameter branches, not tangled logic. They read top-to-bottom and each branch has a clear exit. The complexity allowlist is currently empty — no function exceeds CC 20.

## Adding a new documented exception

If a legitimately complex new function needs to exceed CC 20 (rare), do this in the same PR as the function:

1. Add a row to the table above: file, function, CC, and a one-sentence "why it's complex" that names the specific structural reason.
2. Add an entry to the `ALLOWLIST` dict in [`scripts/check_complexity.sh`](../../scripts/check_complexity.sh) mapping `(filename, qualified_name) → max CC`. This is the gate's per-function ceiling.
3. Mention the exception in the PR description so reviewers see it.

If you can't write a one-sentence justification, the function probably needs refactoring, not documentation.

## Checking complexity locally

```bash
./scripts/check_complexity.sh        # Gate check (CC > 20 fails)
uv run radon cc src/apple_mail_mcp -n B -s   # See all functions rated B (CC 6+) or worse
uv run radon cc src/apple_mail_mcp -n C -s   # See all functions rated C (CC 11+) or worse
```
