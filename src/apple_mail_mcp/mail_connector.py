        timeout: AppleEvent timeout in seconds. Callers pass ``self.timeout``.

    """Wrap a tell-block body with ASObjC imports and an NSJSONSerialization return.

    The `body` must:
      - Contain a `tell application "Mail" ... end tell` block.
      - Assign the final result to an AppleScript variable named `resultData`
        inside that tell block.
      - Handle failures EITHER by letting AppleScript errors propagate via
        stderr (preserves _run_applescript's typed exception mapping, e.g.,
        MailAccountNotFoundError) OR by catching them in a try block and
        returning "ERROR: <message>" (surfaces as MailAppleScriptError on
        the Python side). Use the stderr path when the caller relies on
        typed exceptions; use the "ERROR:" path otherwise.

    The wrapper:
      - Prepends `use framework "Foundation"` and `use scripting additions`.
      - Optionally inserts top-level `handlers` (e.g. ``_MAILBOX_RESOLVER_HANDLERS``)
        between the `use` statements and the `with timeout` block. Handlers
        must be defined at script top level (outside any `tell` block) so
        the body inside the tell can call them with ``my handlerName(...)``.
      - Wraps the body in `with timeout of {timeout} seconds ... end timeout`
        so Mail's default 60 s AppleEvent timeout does not fire before the
        connector's subprocess timeout — see issue #227. Without this,
        per-message property fetches on Exchange/EWS mailboxes (server-
        bound, not local) trip `AppleEvent timed out (-1712)` and leave the
        scripting bridge in `Connection is invalid (-609)` for ~30 s.
      - After the tell block, serializes `resultData` via NSJSONSerialization
        and returns the resulting NSString as text. The serializer runs in
        the ASObjC bridge (no AppleEvent) so it is intentionally OUTSIDE the
        timeout block — but `resultData` is still visible because AppleScript
        `with timeout` is a control construct, not a scope.

    Args:
        body: AppleScript tell-block source setting `resultData`.
        timeout: AppleEvent timeout in seconds for the wrapped tell block.
            Callers should pass ``self.timeout`` so the in-script timeout
            matches the subprocess-level kill timer.
        handlers: Optional AppleScript handler block to inject at script

    """Emit the AppleScript repeat block for a bulk-mutation operation.

    When `account` and `source_mailbox` are both provided, emits a narrow
    O(N) loop scoped to a single mailbox. When both are None, falls back
    to the legacy O(N × accounts × mailboxes) cross-scan for backwards
    compatibility. Any partial-pair raises ValueError — a mailbox name
    without an account is ambiguous (the same name can exist across
    multiple accounts).

    Args:
        account: Account name or UUID, or None.
        source_mailbox: Source mailbox name, or None.
        actions: One or more AppleScript statements to run inside the
            loop once a message is matched (under `if matched then`).
            Each id is matched in TWO sequential attempts — first by
            Mail's internal numeric `id`, then (if that misses) by the
            RFC 5322 `message id`. This lets callers pass either form:
            read tools hand back the RFC Message-ID on the IMAP path,
            which a numeric `id` never equals (the cause of silent
            `updated:0` patches; #205-family). The two predicates are
            kept in SEPARATE `whose` clauses on purpose — combining them
            as `whose (id is X or message id is X)` makes Mail's query
            compiler fail the whole filter when X is a non-numeric RFC
            id (the `id is X` integer comparison poisons the `or`),
            matching nothing. The `message id` arm itself queries BOTH
            the bare and `<bracketed>` forms (`message id is A or message
            id is B` — safe, both are string comparisons), mirroring
            `find_message_by_message_id`: IMAP-backed accounts store the
            id bare, but other paths may store it bracketed per RFC 5322
            (#232). The counter increment is appended automatically.

            Performance: on the cross-scan path (no `source_mailbox`) the
            `message id` fallback is NOT indexed (~20s/mailbox on a real
            account; see APPLESCRIPT_GOTCHAS.md) and fires once per mailbox
            for any RFC id, since the numeric `id` arm always misses for
            those. Callers holding an RFC id should pass `account` +
            `source_mailbox` to take the narrow single-mailbox path.
        counter_var: Name of the AppleScript counter variable (e.g.
            "updateCount", "moveCount") that gets incremented per success.

    Returns:
        AppleScript fragment ready to interpolate into a `tell application

            property if non-empty, else falls back to the first entry of
            `email addresses`.

            `user name` is the credential Mail.app itself sends as the IMAP
            LOGIN — it's the source of truth. `email addresses` is the SMTP
            From list, which usually overlaps with `user name` for Gmail /
            Yahoo / @icloud.com-primary accounts but diverges for iCloud
            accounts whose Apple ID is on a custom domain (Apple's "Custom
            Email Domain" setup): there `email_addresses[0]` is an SMTP-
            only From alias that the IMAP server rejects with
            AUTHENTICATIONFAILED, while `user name` (the Apple ID itself)
            is what the server actually accepts. Preferring `user name`
            matches Mail.app's own behavior in every configuration we've
            seen. (#201)

            Inverse case (#299): an iCloud account whose Apple ID is a
            *third-party* email (e.g. a gmail-based Apple ID). There
            `user name` is the gmail address, which iCloud's IMAP server
            (*.mail.me.com) rejects — it wants the account's own
            @icloud.com/@me.com address. So for iCloud IMAP hosts, when
            `user name` is not itself Apple-hosted, we prefer an
            Apple-hosted entry from `email addresses` (falling back to
            `user name` when none exists, which keeps the #201 custom-domain
            case correct).

        Keychain entry, a revoked password, or a dropped network still gets
        working search via AppleScript.

        When ``include_attachments=True``, every row includes an
        ``attachments`` field with the same shape as ``mail.get_attachments``
        rows (``name``, ``mime_type``, ``size``, ``downloaded``). On the IMAP
        path this is essentially free (BODYSTRUCTURE bundles into the same
        FETCH); on the AppleScript fallback, per-row attachment enumeration
        can be expensive on cold caches — see the ``include_attachments``
        notes in TOOLS.md and #142.

        ``body_contains`` and ``text_contains`` filter by message content
        (RFC 3501 ``BODY`` / ``TEXT`` semantics on IMAP; ``content of msg``
        on AppleScript). On AppleScript these can be very slow — measured
        148s for 100 cold-cache messages on a 47k-message INBOX. When the
        call commits to AppleScript and a body/text filter is set,

        scan plus per-attachment property reads. Falls back to AppleScript

        path matches against the RFC 5322 ``Message-ID`` header (the
        form ``search_messages`` returns when delegated through IMAP).
        The AppleScript path matches Mail.app's internal numeric id.
        Forward the same ``account`` + ``mailbox`` you used for
        ``search_messages`` to keep the paths consistent.

        Note on ``downloaded``: on the IMAP path, ``downloaded`` is
        always ``False`` — BODYSTRUCTURE returns metadata only, and
        Mail.app's local-cache state isn't observable from the IMAP
        protocol. On the AppleScript path it reflects Mail.app's cache.

        For ``seed="new"`` save-as-draft (``send_now=False``) with a known
        ``from_account``, the draft is created via IMAP APPEND of a clean
        RFC 822 message rather than Mail.app's AppleScript ``content``
        setter, which wraps the body in a cite-blockquote that renders as
        a quote on iOS (Mail.app bug FB11734014, #245). Falls back to the
        AppleScript path when IMAP isn't configured.

        ``seed="reply"`` / ``seed="forward"`` save-as-draft also use the
        clean IMAP path when ``seed_id`` is an RFC Message-ID and
        ``from_account`` is known: the original is fetched from
        ``seed_mailbox`` (default INBOX), and the quoted body + ``Re:``/
        ``Fwd:`` subject + ``In-Reply-To``/``References`` threading are
        rebuilt in plain text (forwards carry the original's attachments).
        Falls back to AppleScript when IMAP isn't configured or the
        original isn't in ``seed_mailbox``. ``send_now=True`` still uses
        AppleScript.

        After an IMAP-path APPEND the account is synchronized so the draft
        appears in Mail.app's local Drafts pane promptly rather than after
        Mail's background poll (#269); a brief lag can still remain since
        Mail controls the final UI refresh.

        Args:
            seed: ``"new"``, ``"reply"``, or ``"forward"``.
            seed_id: Identifier of the message to reply/forward. Accepts
                either Mail's internal numeric id OR an RFC 5322
                Message-ID (with or without angle brackets). The latter
                is what read tools (``search_messages`` / ``get_messages``)
                emit as ``id`` on the IMAP path (#148), so callers can
                forward those ids verbatim. Required when ``seed != "new"``.
            seed_mailbox: Folder the seed message lives in, used by the
                clean reply/forward IMAP path to fetch the original
                (default INBOX). Supply it for replies to filed mail; a
                miss falls back to AppleScript (which resolves across all
                folders). Ignored for ``seed="new"``.
            to/cc/bcc: Recipient lists. For reply/forward, ``None`` keeps
                Mail's auto-derived recipients; an empty list explicitly
                clears that group; a populated list replaces.
            subject: Subject. For ``seed="new"`` this is required by the
                caller. For reply/forward, ``None`` keeps Mail's
                auto-derived ``Re:``/``Fwd:`` prefix; non-None overrides.
            body: Body text. For reply/forward, prepended above the
                auto-quoted original (``body + "\\n\\n" + auto-content``).
            attachment_paths: List of file paths. Each must exist.
            reply_all: For ``seed="reply"`` only — use ``reply to all``.
            from_account: Mail.app account name or UUID; ``None`` uses
                Mail's default sender for the seed message. When ``None``
                on a save-as-draft and exactly one enabled account exists,
                that account is adopted so the clean IMAP path can engage
                (it is Mail's default sender anyway, so the From is
                unchanged). (#321)
            on_warning: Optional callback invoked with a human-readable
                string when a save-as-draft falls back to the AppleScript
                path (whose body carries Mail.app's cite-blockquote wrapper,
                FB11734014) instead of the clean IMAP path. (#270)
            send_now: ``False`` saves as draft and returns
                ``{"draft_id": ...}``. ``True`` sends and returns
                ``{"draft_id": "", "sent_message_id": ""}`` (sent_message_id
                is empty on this version — recovering the just-sent message
                across IMAP sync is unreliable).

        Returns:
            ``{"draft_id": <persisted-id>, "sent_message_id": <id-or-empty>}``.

        Raises:
            ValueError: invalid seed or missing required fields.
            MailAccountNotFoundError: ``from_account`` doesn't match.
            MailMessageNotFoundError: ``seed_id`` not found in any mailbox.
