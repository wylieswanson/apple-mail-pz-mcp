# imapclient ships without a py.typed marker, so Pyright/Pylance can't verify
# argument types against its public API. Mypy is configured to ignore missing
# imports for the imapclient package via [[tool.mypy.overrides]] in
# pyproject.toml; Pyright respects file-level pragmas instead. The three
# suppressed categories cover the false positives that arise when calling
# search() / fetch() with list-shaped criteria and reading Envelope/BodyData
# fields. Suppression is scoped to this file so unrelated type bugs elsewhere
# in the codebase still surface.
"""IMAPClient wrapper for read operations.

Stateless, per-call connection lifecycle. This module is deliberately
unaware of Mail.app, Keychain, and the MCP server. It takes fully-
resolved credentials and talks IMAP. Callers (tests here; the
delegation layer in #40 later) are responsible for correlating
Mail.app account name → (host, port, email) and fetching the
password via ``keychain.get_imap_password``.

          ``X-GM-EXT-1`` is advertised but All Mail is hidden over IMAP
          (per-folder-size opt-out in Gmail Settings — common). Find
          the anchor's UID + X-GM-THRID in INBOX or Sent, then search
          every selectable folder by X-GM-THRID. ~2+M*2 round-trips
          (~186 on a 92-folder account vs ~1100 for BFS).

        - **Tier 2 (RFC 5256 THREAD)** (#123) — when ``THREAD=REFERENCES``
          or ``THREAD=REFS`` is advertised (Fastmail, some Dovecot;
          NOT Gmail typically, NOT iCloud). Per mailbox: a single
          THREAD command returns nested UID tuples representing the
          full thread structure; walk to find clusters containing
          relevant UIDs. ~M*2-4 round-trips depending on anchor
          locality.

        - **Tier 3 (header-search BFS)** — universal fallback. Iterates
          every mailbox; searches Message-ID / In-Reply-To /
          References for every known thread ID. Used on iCloud and
          any provider not covered above. Also used when a higher tier
